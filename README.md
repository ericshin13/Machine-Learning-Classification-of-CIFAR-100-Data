# Machine Learning Classification of CIFAR-100 Data

This project addressed a fictional monitoring challenge set in Jurassic Park. Our data science team tracked dinosaur locations across the park using motion-sensitive cameras. As the ecosystem expanded, the cameras were increasingly triggered by large non-reptile animals, introducing noise into detection data. We developed a machine learning model to distinguish reptiles from large mammals, prioritizing recall as the primary evaluation metric to minimize missed dinosaur detections.

Our model was trained using the CIFAR-100 dataset from University of Toronto. The dataset contains 100 classes with 600 images per class consisting of animals, objects, and people. Each image is represented as a 32x32x3 tensor, corresponding to 1,024 pixels across three color channels (red, green, and blue), resulting in 3,072 numerical features per image.
