# Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-Reptiles

This project addressed a fictional monitoring challenge set in Jurassic Park. Our data science team tracked dinosaur locations across the park using motion-sensitive cameras. As the ecosystem expanded, the cameras were increasingly triggered by large non-reptile animals, introducing noise into detection data. We developed a machine learning model to distinguish reptiles from large mammals, prioritizing recall as the primary evaluation metric to minimize missed dinosaur detections.
